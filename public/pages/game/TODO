    -disable the debug animation (there is a flag for this in game.js); probably leave up for now
    -animation selection
        -damage event shows hurt, then goes back
    -add audio events??? music tool can be a reference here; but an esoteric one
    -set up remaining animations? this will be clearer once game is running
    -clean up enemy when die?

    -prop entity - gameenitytspawner should do this in tick
    -prop entity clean up after passes off bottom screen
    -slow enimies
    -spawn rate
        -variable rate spawning??? do well you get faster enemies, lose a guy, slows down
    -youlose / restart
        -audio
nice to haves:
    -pencil death animation
    -easier spawn?
    -colors

jake:
    x-change move vector to be towards king when passed certain y threshold
    x-make enemys run at king if at king's y value
        -new state: chase king!
            -updates move vector to be = normalize(kingPos - enemyPos);
    x-spawn friends closer, potentially right in front

matt:
    -stop drag when things are killed
    x-side paper
    -pick up shows dangly legs, then drop returns
    -in camera tick, read bool to not listen to input (so we don't have ability to walk/run)
